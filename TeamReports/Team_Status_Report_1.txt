Second Section: 
We have organized our team and gotten to know each other. We have also set up our trello board and have gotten some plans and goals on there. We didn’t have any problems, 
as we haven't done too much development and since we are just getting used to planning out our group meetings. We are also not stuck with anything yet! 

Third Section:
Our plans are to continue to develop a view of a project/tasks and to start development on some other things that haven’t been fully decided yet. 

Fourth Section: 
The agenda for our meeting with our instructional team will be centered around the things we could add functionality to our app and some things we could add to make our app better!
